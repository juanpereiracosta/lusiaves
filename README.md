## Lusiaves Web Application
This repository serves as the central overview for the Lusiaves web application, developed for the Lusiaves company. It connects the two main parts of the project: the frontend and the backend API.

## Project Structure
The project consists of two repositories:

- [Frontend](https://github.com/juanpereiracosta/lusiaves-frontend): built with Vue.js, Nuxt 3, Vuetify, and TypeScript. Handles Excel file uploads via a user-friendly interface.
- [Backend API](https://github.com/juanpereiracosta/lusiaves-api): built with AdonisJS and TypeScript, processes Excel uploads and stores data in a PostgreSQL database managed through DBeaver.

## Overview
Lusiaves is a web application where users upload Excel files containing data for specific tables in a PostgreSQL database. The frontend manages user interaction and file uploads, displaying the date, time, and name of the last user who uploaded, while the backend API processes and securely stores the data.
